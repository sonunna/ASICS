time of the vcc power supply must not be faster thant vcc ma for example if vcc and cext pf the vcc supply must turn off no faster thant pf ma ns usually this is not problem because power supplies are heavily filteredand can not discharge at this rate when more rapid decrease of vcc to zero occurs the devicescan sustain damage to avoid this possibility use external clamping diodes output pulse

vdiv is internally converted into result divcode vdiv may be generated by resistor divider between and gnd use resistors to ensure an accurate result the div pin and resistors should be shielded from

pol the output produces positive pulse when pol the output produces negative pulse set pin pulse width setting input the voltage on the set pin vset is regulated to above gnd the amount of current sourced from the set pin iset the master oscillator frequency the iset current range is to the output pulse will continue indefinitely if iset drops below approximately and will terminate when iset increases again resistor connected between set and gnd is the most accurate way to set the pulse width for best performance use precision metal or thin film resistor of or better tolerance and or better temperature coefficient for lower accuracy applications an inexpensive thick film resistor may be used limit the capacitance on the set pin to less than to minimize jitter and ensure stability capacitance less than maintains the stability of the feedback circuit regulating the vset pin trigger input depending on the rising or falling edge on trig will initiate the output pulse and are and are sensitive the and are retriggerable allowing the pulse width to be extended by additional trigger signals that occur while the output is active the will ignore additional trigger inputs until the output pulse has terminated gnd pin ground tie to low inductance ground plane for best performance out pin output the out pin swings from gnd to with an output resistance of approximately when driving an led or other low impedance load series output resistor should be used to limit current to for more information block diagram package pin numbers shown master tmaster programmable divider halt oscillatorif iset for more information operationthe is built around master oscillator with minimum period the oscillator is controlled by the set pin current iset and voltage vset with conversion factor that is accurate to under typical conditions tmaster feedback loop maintains vset at leaving iset as the primary means of controlling the pulse width the simplest way to generate iset is to connect resistor rset between set and gnd such that iset the master oscillator equation reduces to tmaster from this equation it is clear that vset drift will not affect the pulse width when using single program resistor rset error sources are limited to rset tolerance and the inherent pulse width accuracy of the may range from to equivalent to iset between and trigger signal rising or falling edge on trig pin latches the output to the active state beginning the output pulse at the same time the master oscillator is enabled to time the duration of the output pulse when the desired pulse width is reached the master oscillator resets the output latch the also includes programmable frequency divider which can further divide the frequency by or this extends the pulse width duration by those same factors the divider ratio ndiv is set by resistor divider attached to the div pin divcodethe div pin connects to an internal referenced converter that determines the divcode value divcode programs two settings on the divcode determines the frequency divider setting ndiv divcode determines the polarity of out pin via the pol bit vdiv may be generated by resistor divider between and gnd as shown in figure figure simple technique for setting divcode table offers recommended resistor values that produce the correct voltage division as well as the corresponding ndiv and pol values for the recommended resistor pairs other values may be used as long the ratio is accurate to including tor tolerances and temperature effects the driving impedance does not exceed if the voltage is generated by other means the output of dac it must track the supply voltage the last column in table shows the ideal ratio of vdiv to the supply voltage which can also be calculated as tout with rset in place of the equation reduces to tout ndiv for example if the supply is and the desired divcode is vdiv illustrates the information in table showing that ndiv is symmetric around the divcode midpoint for more information table divcode programming recommended to vdiv figure pulse width range and pol bit vs divcode for more information operationmonostable multivibrator one shot the is monostable multivibrator trigger signal on the trig input will force the output to the active unstable state for programmable duration this type of circuit is commonly referred to as pulse generator figures details the basic operation rising edge on the trig pin initiates the output pulse the pulse width tout is determined by the ndiv setting and by the rset connected to the set pin subsequent rising edges on trig have no affect until the completion of the one shot and for short rearming time tarm thereafter to ensure proper operation positive and negative trig pulses should be at least twidth and allow the output pulse to be retriggered as shown in figure the output pulse will stay high until tout after the last on trig successive trigger signals can extend the pulse width consecutive trigger signals must be separated by tretrig to be recognized negative trigger versions in addition to the retrigger option the family also includes negative input versions these four combinations are detailed in table table retrigger and input polarity options input output polarity pol bit each variety of also offers the ability to invert the output producing negative pulses this option is programmed along with ndiv by the choice of divcode the previous section describes how to program divcode using the div pin figure timing diagram pol figure retriggering timing diagram pol for more information time when power is first applied the reset por circuit will initiate the time tstart the out pin is held low during this time the typical value for tstart ranges from to depending on the master frequency independent of ndiv during the div pin converter must the correct divcode before an output pulse can be generated the time may increase if the supply or div pin voltages are not stable for this reason it is recommended to minimize the capacitance on the div pin so it will properly track less than will not extend the time the divcode setting is recognized at the end of the startup up if pol the output will transition high otherwise if pol out simply remains low at this point the is ready to respond to edges on the trig input tstart trig ignored figure timing diagram operationchanging divcode after following the converter will continue monitoring vdiv for changes changes to divcode will be recognized slowly as the places priority on eliminating any wandering in the divcode the typical delay depends on the difference between the old and new divcode settings and is proportional to the master oscillator period change in divcode will not be recognized until it is stable and will not pass through intermediate codes digital filter is used to guarantee the divcode has settled to new value before making changes to the output if the output pulse is active during the transition the pulse width can take on value between the two settings figure divcode change from to figure divcode change from to for more information applications informationbasic operation the simplest and most accurate method to program the is to use single resistor rset between the set and gnd pins the design procedure is four step process alternatively linear technology offers the timerblox designer tool to quickly design any based circuit use the free timerblox one shot design tool step select the pol bit setting the can generate positive or negative output pulses depending on the setting of the pol bit the pol bit is the divcode msb so any divcode has pol and produces pulses step select version two choices dictate the proper for given application is trig rising or input should retriggering be allowed use table to select particular variety of step select the ndiv frequency divider explained earlier the voltage on the div pin sets the divcode which determines both the pol bit and the ndiv value for given output pulse width tout ndiv should be selected to be within the following range to minimize supply current choose the lowest ndiv value however in some cases higher value for ndiv will provide better accuracy see electrical characteristics table can also be used to select the appropriate ndiv values for the desired tout pol already chosen this completes the selection of divcode use table to select the proper resistor divider or ratio to apply to the div pin step calculate and select final step is to calculate the correct value for rset using the following equation rset select the standard resistor value closest to the calculated value example design circuit that satisfies the requirements tout negative output trigger retriggerable minimum power consumption step select the pol bit setting for inverted negative output pulse choose pol step select the version retriggerable input requires the step select the ndiv frequency divider an ndiv value that meets the requirements of equation using tout ndiv settings for ndiv include and ndiv is the best choice as it minimizes supply current by large rset resistor pol and ndiv requires divcode using table choose and values to program divcode step select rset the correct value for rset using equation rset for more information figure pulse width digital pulse width control the control voltage can be generated by dac converter resulting in pulse width many dacs allow for the use of an external if such dac is used to provide the vctrl voltage the vset dependency can be eliminated by buffering vset and using it as the dac reference voltage as shown in figure the dac output voltage now tracks any vset variation and eliminates it as an error source the set pin can not be tied directly to the reference input of the dac because the current drawn by the dac ref input would affect the pulse width applications informationsince is not available as standard resistor substitute if shift in tout is acceptable otherwise select parallel or series pair of resistors such as and to attain more precise resistance the completed design is shown in figure figure negative pulse generator pulse width with one additional resistor the output pulse width can be manipulated by an external voltage as shown in figure voltage vctrl current through rmod to vary the iset current which in turn modulates the pulse width as described in equation tout ndiv tout ndiv figure digitally controlled pulse width for more information applications informationiset extremes master oscillator frequency extremes when operating with iset outside of the recommended to range the master oscillator operates outside of the to range in which it is most accurate the oscillator will still function with reduced accuracy for iset at approximately the oscillator will stop under this condition the output pulse can still be initiated but will not terminate until iset increases and the master oscillator starts again at the other extreme it is not recommended to operate the master oscillator beyond because the accuracy of the div pin adc will suffer settling time following or step change in iset the output pulse width takes approximately six master clock cycles tmaster to settle to within of the final value an example is shown in figure using the circuit in figure pulse figure typical settling time coupling error the current sourced by the set pin is used to bias the master oscillator the responds to changes in iset almost immediately which provides excellent settling time however this fast response also makes the set pin sensitive to coupling from digital signals such as the trig input even an excellent layout will allow some coupling between trig and set additional error is included in the accuracy for ndiv to account for this figure shows that supply variation is dependent on coupling from rising or falling trigger inputs and to lesser extent output polarity very poor layout can actually degrade performance further the pcb layout should avoid routing set next to trig or any other signal figure tout drift vs supply voltage for more information cload duty cycle figure is active vs output duty cycle applications informationpower supply current the electrical characteristics table specifies the supply current while the part is idle waiting to be triggered is idle varies with the programmed tout and the supply voltage once triggered the instantaneous supply current increases to is active while the timing circuit is active is active is idle active the average increase in supply current active on the output duty cycle or negative duty cycle if pol since that represents the percentage of time that the circuit is active is idle and active can be estimated using the equations in table figure shows how the supply current increases from is idle as the input frequency increases the increase is smaller at higher ndiv settings table typical supply current typical is

accurate monostable multivibrator when used in the appropriate manner the part is simple to use and by following few rules the expected performance is easily achieved adequate supply bypassing and proper pcb layout are important to ensure this figure shows example pcb layouts for both the and dcb packages using sized passive components the layouts assume two layer board with ground plane layer beneath and around the these layouts are guide and need not be followed connect the bypass capacitor directly to the and gnd pins using low inductance path the connection from to the pin is easily done directly on the top layer for the dcb package connection to gnd is also simply done on the top layer for the out can be routed through the pads to allow good gnd connection if the pcb design rules do not allow that gnd connection can be accomplished through multiple vias to the ground plane multiple vias for both the gnd pin connection to the ground plane and the connection to the ground plane are recommended to minimize the inductance capacitor should be ceramic capacitor place all passive components on the top side of the board this minimizes trace inductance place rset as close as possible to the set pin and make direct short connection the set pin is summing node and currents injected into this pin directly modulate the output pulse width having short connection minimizes the exposure to signal pickup connect rset directly to the gnd pin using long path or vias to the ground plane will not have significant affect on accuracy but direct short connection is recommended and easy to apply use ground trace to shield the set pin this provides another layer of protection from radiated signals place and close to the div pin direct short connection to the div pin minimizes the

operation following as shown in figure and before an input triggeroccurs the monostable is in the quiescent state with the qoutput low and the timing capacitor cx completely chargedto vdd when the trigger input goes from vss to vdd while inputs and reset are held to vdd valid trigger isrecognized which turns on comparator and at the same time the output latch is set withtransistor on the capacitor cx rapidly discharges towardvss until is reached at this point the output ofcomparator changes state and transistor turns then turns off while at the same timecomparator turns on with transistor off the capacitorcx begins to charge through the timing resistor rx towardvdd when the voltage across cx equals vref changes state causing the output latch to reset goeslow while at the same time disabling comparator thisends at the timing cycle with the monostable in the quiescentstate waiting for the next trigger in the quiescent state cx is fully charged to vdd causingthe current through resistor rx to be zero both comparatorsare off with total device current due only to reversejunction leakages an added feature of the isthat the output latch is set via the input trigger without regardto the capacitor voltage thus propagation delay fromtrigger to is independent of the value of cx rx or the dutycycle of the input waveform retrigger operation the is retriggered if valid trigger occurs followed by another valid trigger before the output hasreturned to the quiescent zero state any retrigger after thetiming node voltage at pin or has begun to rise fromvref but has not yet reached vref will cause an increasein output pulse width when valid retrigger is initiated the voltage at will again drop to vref beforeprogressing along the rc charging curve toward vdd theq output will remain high until time after the last validretrigger on reset sets the reset latch and causes the capacitor to befast charged to vdd by turning on transistor when thevoltage on the capacitor reaches vref the reset latch willclear and will then be ready to accept another pulse it thereset input is held low any trigger inputs that occur will beinhibited and the and outputs of the output latch will notchange since the output is reset when an input low levelis detected on the reset input the output pulse can be madesignificantly shorter than the minimum pulse widthspecification considerations large capacitance values can cause problems due to thelarge amount of energy stored when system containingthe is powered down the capacitor voltage maydischarge from vdd through the standard protection diodesat pin or current through the protection diodes shouldbe limited to ma and therefore the discharge time of thevdd supply must not be faster than vdd ma example if vdd and cx the vdd supplyshould discharge no faster than ma ms this is normally not problem since powersupplies are heavily filtered and can not discharge at this more rapid decrease of vdd to zero volts occurs

LTC6993HS6-3#WTRMPBF,Analog Devices Inc.,tape and reel packaging introduction the electronics industry is making tremendous investment in technology the reasons for this investment include cost savings resulting from automated component placement and increased density of pcb layout due to smaller package sizes today placement machines can pick and place thousands of components per hour with very high degree of accuracy to achieve this performance the component delivery system must be capable of feeding parts at high speeds in consistent orientation positively indexed to the demands of the machine the leads of the components must be protected from damage during shipment handling and placement the preferred packing material available today for these demands is tape and reel analog devices tape and reel system is fully with the detaping equipment that is standard in most automated placement equipment in the tape and reel format the components are placed in specifically designed pockets embossed in plastic carrier tape the cover tape is sealed to the carrier tape to keep the parts in place in these pockets row of sprocket holes is provided along one edge of the embossed tape to facilitate positive indexing the tape is then wound onto rigid plastic reel that provides mechanical protection during handling and storage these reels are and compatible with clean environment
