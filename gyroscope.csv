root allan deviation at vs averaging time figure typical noise spectral density bandwidth hz theory of operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyroscope two polysilicon sensing structures each contain dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance producing the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force while rotating at two of the outer extremes of each frame orthogonal to the dither motion are movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers to form capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the design rejects external forces and vibration fabricating the sensor with signal conditioning electronics preserves signal integrity in noisy environments the electrostatic resonator requires to for operation because only are typically available in most applications charge pump is included on chip if an external to supply is available the two capacitors on through can be omitted and this supply can be connected to the pin note that should not be grounded when power is applied to the although no damage occurs under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the setting bandwidth external capacitor cout is used in combination with the rout resistor to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is and can be well controlled because rout is trimmed during manufacturing to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and the sumj pin results in in general an additional hardware or software filter is added to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the gyroscope khz resonant frequency the noise spikes at khz can be clearly seen in the power spectral density curve shown in figure typically the corner frequency of this additional filter is set to greater than the required bandwidth to preserve good phase response figure shows the effect of adding hz filter to the output of an set to hz bandwidth as shown in figure high frequency demodulation artifacts are attenuated by approximately db frequency hz figure noise spectral density with additional hz filter temperature output and calibration it is common practice to gyroscopes to improve their overall accuracy the has proportional voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and temperature coefficient therefore buffering the output is recommended the voltage at the temp pin is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is at although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure calibrated performance using calibration technique it is possible to calibrate the null and sensitivity drift of the to an overall accuracy of nearly an overall accuracy of or better is possible using more points limiting the bandwidth of the device reduces the noise during the calibration process improving the accuracy at each calibration point and supply ratiometricity function the rateout and temp signals are ratiometric to the vratio voltage that is the null voltage rate sensitivity and temperature outputs are proportional to vratio thus the is most easily used with adc that results in of errors due to minor supply variations there is some small error due to nonratiometric behavior typical ratiometricity error for null sensitivity and temperature output is outlined in table note that vratio must never be greater than avcc table ratiometricity error for various parameters parameter mean sigma mean sigma mean sigma sensitivity mean sigma mean sigma null adjustment the nominal null is for symmetrical swing range at rateout however nonsymmetrical output swing may be suitable in some applications null adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may reflect some null instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics as if subjected to angular rate it is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change about and causes an opposite change of the response follows the viscosity temperature dependence of the package atmosphere approximately activating both and simultaneously is not damaging and are fairly closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch and are activated by applying voltage of greater than vratio to the and pins and are by applying voltage of less than vratio to the and pins the voltage applied to and must never be greater than avcc continuous the integration of the gives it higher reliability than is obtainable with any other high volume manufacturing method in addition it is manufactured under mature bimos process with reliability as an additional failure detection measure can be

the lsb value is address this solution permits the connection and addressing of two different gyroscopes to the same bus data transfer with acknowledge is mandatory the transmitter must release the sda line during the acknowledge pulse the receiver must then pull the data line low so that it remains stable low during the high period of the acknowledge clock pulse receiver which has been addressed is obliged to generate an acknowledge after each byte of data embedded in the behaves like slave device and the following protocol must be adhered to after the start st condition slave address is sent once slave acknowledge sak has been returned an is transmitted the lsb represent the actual register address while the msb enables address if the msb of the sub field is the sub register address is automatically incremented to allow multiple data the slave address is completed with bit if the bit is read repeated start sr condition must be issued after the two bytes if the

master is writing one byte to slave digital interfaces table transfer when master is writing multiple bytes to slave table transfer when master is receiving reading one byte of data from slave table transfer when master is receiving reading multiple bytes of data from slave master st sr sak data data are transmitted in byte format data each data transfer contains bits the number of bytes transferred per transfer is unlimited data is transferred with the most significant bit msb first if receiver can not receive another complete byte of data until it has performed some other function it can hold the clock line scl low to force the transmitter into wait state data transfer only continues when the receiver is ready for another byte and releases the data line if slave receiver does not acknowledge the slave address it is not able to receive because it is performing some function the data line must be left high by the slave the master can then abort the transfer low to high transition on the sda line while the scl line is high is defined as stop condition each data transfer must be terminated by the generation of stop sp condition in order to read multiple bytes it is necessary to assert the most significant bit of the field in other words sub must be equal to while sub represents the address of the first register to be read in the presented communication format

averaging time figure typical noise spectral density bandwidth hz theory of operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyro two polysilicon sensing structures each contain dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance producing the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force during angular rate at two of the outer extremes of each frame orthogonal to the dither motion are movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers to form capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produces the electrical rate signal output the design rejects external and vibration fabricating the sensor with the signal conditioning electronics preserves signal integrity in noisy environments the electrostatic resonator requires to for operation because only are typically available in most applications charge pump is included on chip if an external to supply is available the two capacitors on through can be omitted and this supply can be connected to pin pin note that should not be grounded when power is applied to the although no damage occurs under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the setting bandwidth external capacitor cout is used in combination with the rout resistor to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is this frequency can be well controlled because rout has been trimmed during manufacturing to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and sumj pin results in in general an additional hardware or software filter is added to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the gyro khz resonant frequency the noise spikes at khz can be clearly seen in the power spectral density curve shown in figure typically this additional filter corner frequency is set to greater than the required bandwidth to preserve good phase response figure shows the effect of adding hz filter to the output of an set to hz bandwidth as shown in figure high frequency demodulation artifacts are attenuated by approximately db frequency hz figure noise spectral density with additional hz filter temperature output and calibration it is common practice to gyros to improve their overall accuracy the has temperature voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and temperature coefficient therefore the output is recommended the voltage at the temp pin is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is at although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure calibrated performance using calibration technique it is possible to calibrate the null and sensitivity drift of the to an overall accuracy of nearly an overall accuracy of or better is possible using more points limiting the bandwidth of the device reduces the noise during the calibration process improving the accuracy at each calibration point and supply ratiometricity null adjustment the rateout and temp signals are ratiometric to the vratio voltage that is the null voltage rate sensitivity and temperature outputs are proportional to vratio thus the is most easily used with adc that results in of errors due to minor supply variations there is some small error due to nonratiometric behavior typical ratiometricity error for null sensitivity and temperature output is outlined in table note that vratio must never be greater than avcc table ratiometricity error for various parameters parameter mean sigma mean sigma mean sigma sensitivity mean sigma mean sigma the nominal null is for symmetrical swing range at rateout however nonsymmetrical output swing may be suitable in some applications null adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may reflect some null instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case function the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics as if subjected to angular rate it is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change about and causes an opposite change of the response follows the viscosity temperature dependence of the package atmosphere approximately activating both and simultaneously is not damaging and are fairly closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch and are activated by applying voltage equal to vratio to the and pins the voltage applied to and must never be greater than avcc continuous the integration of the gives it higher reliability than is obtainable with any other high volume manufacturing method in addition it is manufactured under mature bimos

nonlinearity four typical devices data sheet theory of operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyro figure shows simplified version of one of four polysilicon sensing structures each sensing structure contains dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance this the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force when experiencing angular rate the is designed to sense yaw angular rate when the sensing structure is exposed to angular rate the coriolis force couples into an outer sense frame which contains movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers this forms capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the quad sensor design rejects linear and angular acceleration including external and vibration this is achieved by mechanically coupling the four sensing structures such that external appear as signals

no damage occurs but under certain the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the setting the bandwidth external capacitor cout is used in combination with the rout resistor to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is fout can be well controlled because rout has been trimmed during manufacturing to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and the sumj pin results in in general an additional filter in either hardware or software is added to attenuate

gyro sensing corner data sheet temperature output and calibration function it is common practice to gyros to improve their overall accuracy the has temperature voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and its temperature coefficient therefore buffering the output is recommended the voltage at temp is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is at although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure modifying the measurement range the scale factor can be reduced to extend the measurement range to as much as by adding single kω resistor between the rateout and sumj pins if an external resistor is added between rateout and sumj cout must be proportionally increased to maintain correct bandwidth null bias adjustment the nominal null bias is for symmetrical swing range at rateout however nonsymmetric output swing may be suitable in some applications null bias adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may reflect some null bias instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics in the same manner as if subjected to angular rate the is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change by approximately and causes an opposite change of the response follows the viscosity temperature dependence of the package atmosphere approximately activating and simultaneously does not damage the part and are fairly closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch and are activated by applying voltage equal to vratio to the pin and the pin the voltage applied to and must never be greater than avcc continuous the integration of the gives it higher reliability than is

however the interrupt function can be used to determine when new data is available fifothe ic embeds of data fifo for each of the three output channels yaw pitch and roll this allows consistent power saving for the system since the host processor does not need to continuously poll data from the sensor but it can wake up only when needed and burst the significant data out from the fifo when configured in snapshot mode it offers the ideal to capture the data following rate interrupt event this buffer can work according to four main modes off normal interrupt and snapshot both normal and interrupt modes can be optionally configured to operate in overrun mode depending on whether in case of buffer newer or older data are lost various fifo status flags can be enabled to generate interrupt events on pin fifo off modein this mode the fifo is turned off data are stored only in the data registers and no data are available from the fifo if read when the fifo is turned off there are essentially two options to use the device synchronous and reading synchronous readingin this mode the processor reads the data set bytes for axes configuration generated by the ic every time that is set the processor must read once and only once the data set in order to avoid data inconsistencies maxim integrated benefits of using this approach include the perfect of the signal coming the gyroscope and data traffic asynchronous readingin this mode the processor reads the data generated by the ic regardless the status of the flag to minimize the error caused by different samples being

embeds of data fifo for each of the two output channels pitch and roll this allows consistent power saving for the system since the host does not need to continuously poll data from the sensor but it can wake up only when needed and burst the significant data out from the fifo when configured in snapshot mode it offers the ideal mechanism to capture the data following rate interrupt event this

typical noise spectral density bandwidth hz theory of operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyro two polysilicon sensing structures each contain dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance producing the velocity element to produce coriolis force during angular rate at two of the outer extremes of each frame orthogonal to the dither motion are movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers to form capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the design rejects external and vibration fabricating the sensor with the signal conditioning electronics preserves signal integrity in noisy environments the electrostatic resonator requires to for operation because only are typically available in most applications charge pump is included onchip if an external to supply is available the two capacitors on from can be omitted and this supply can be connected to the pin note that should not be grounded when power is applied to the although no damage occurs under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed if power is not first removed from the setting bandwidth external capacitor cout is used in combination with the rout resistor to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is and can be well controlled because rout has been trimmed during manufacturing to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and sumj pin results in in general an additional hardware or software filter is added to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the khz resonant frequency of the gyro the noise spikes at khz can be clearly seen in the power spectral density curve shown in figure typically this additional filter corner frequency is set to greater than the required bandwidth to preserve good phase response figure shows the effect of adding hz filter to the output of an set to hz bandwidth as shown in figure high frequency demodulation artifacts are attenuated by approximately db figure noise spectral density with additional hz filter temperature output and calibration it is common practice to gyros to improve their overall accuracy the has temperature voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and its temperature coefficient therefore buffering the output is recommended the voltage at the temp pin is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is at although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure calibrated performance using calibration technique it is possible to calibrate the null and sensitivity drift to an overall accuracy of nearly an overall accuracy of or better is possible using more points limiting the bandwidth of the device reduces the noise during the calibration process improving the measurement accuracy at each calibration point and supply ratiometricity null adjustment the rateout and temp signals are ratiometric to the vratio voltage that is the null voltage rate sensitivity and temperature outputs are proportional to vratio therefore the is most easily used with converter adc that results in of errors due to minor supply variations there is some small error due to nonratiometric behavior typical ratiometricity error for null sensitivity and temperature output is outlined in table note that vratio must never be greater than avcc table ratiometricity error for various parameters parameter mean sigma mean sigma mean sigma sensitivity mean sigma mean sigma the nominal null is for symmetrical swing range at rateout however nonsymmetric output swing may be suitable in some applications null adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may reflect some null instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case function the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics as if subjected to angular rate it is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change about and causes an opposite change of the response follows the viscosity temperature dependence of the package atmosphere approximately activating both and simultaneously is not damaging and are fairly closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch and are activated by applying voltage equal to vratio to the pin and the pin the voltage applied to and must never be greater than avcc

communications sensor data digital output temperature interrupt generators mems gyroscope with adcs and signal conditioningthe ic consists of vibratory mems that detects rotations around the and axes when the gyroscope rotates around any of the sensing axes the coriolis force determines displacement which can be detected as capacitive variation the resulting signal is then processed to produce digital stream proportional to the angular rate the conversion uses adc converters the gyro range can be digitally programmed to dps interrupt generatorsthe offers two completely independent generators to ease the sw management of the generated for instance one line could be used to signal event whilst the other line might be used for instance to notify the completion of the startup sequence interrupt functionality can be configured through the interrupt configuration registers configurable items include the int pin level and duration the clearing method as well as the required triggers for the interrupt status can be read from the interrupt status registers the event that has generated an interrupt is available in two forms latched and sources can be and cleared the list of possible interrupt sources includes the following conditions restart interrupt generation can also be configured as latched unlatched or timed with programmable configured as latched the interrupt can be cleared by reading the corresponding status register or by writing an appropriate mask to the status register temperature sensora digital output temperature sensor is used to measure the ic die temperature the readings from the adc can be accessed from the sensor data registers the temperature data is split over bytes for faster and less accurate reading accessing the msb allows to read the temperature data as an absolute value expressed in celsius degrees by reading the lsb the accuracy is greatly increased up to maxim integrated power modesthe ic features four power modes allowing selecting the appropriate tradeoff between power consumption and time the transition between power modes can be controlled by software by explicitly setting power mode in the configuration register or by enabling the automatic power mode transition based on the dsync pin normal modein normal mode the ic is operational with minimum noise level eco modethe eco mode reduces power consumption with the same sensor accuracy at the price of higher rate noise density this unique feature can be activated with four odrs and standby modeto reduce power consumption and have shorter time the ic features standby mode in standby mode the ic does not generate data as significant portion of the signal processing resources is turned off to save power still this mode enables much quicker time modein mode the ic is configured to minimize the power consumption in mode registers can still be read and written but the gyroscope can not generate new data compared to the standby mode it takes longer to the

interface uses separate data pins mosi and miso to transfer data because of the separate data pins bits can be simultaneously clocked into and out of the ic the ic makes use of this feature by clocking out output data bits as the command byte is clocked in reading from the spi slave interface mosi the spi master reads data from the ic slave interface using the following steps when cs is

saving pin in the spi interface the miso pin can be left unconnected in operation the spi master must operate the mosi pin as bidirectional it accesses ic register as follows the mosi master sets the clock to its inactive state while cs is high the master can drive the sdi pin to any value the spi master selects the ic by driving cs low and placing the first data bit msb to write on the sdi input the spi master turns on its output driver and clocks the command byte into the ic the spi read command is performed with clock pulses bit read bit the value is when increment address in multiple readings bit address ad this is the address field of the indexed register bit data do read mode this is the data that is read from the device msb first multiple read command is also available in mode sensor data registersthe sensor data registers contain the latest gyroscope and temperature measurement data they are registers and are accessed through the serial interface data from these registers can be read anytime however the interrupt function can be used to determine when new data is available fifothe ic embeds of data fifo for each of the three output channels yaw and pitch this allows consistent power saving for the system since the host does not need to continuously poll data from the sensor but it can wake up only when needed and burst the significant data out from the fifo when configured in snapshot mode it offers the ideal mechanism to capture the data following rate interrupt event this buffer can work according to four main modes off normal interrupt and snapshot both normal and interrupt modes can be optionally configured to operate in overrun mode depending on whether in case of buffer newer or older data are lost various fifo status flags can be enabled to generate interrupt events on pin fifo off modein this mode the fifo is turned off data are stored only in the data registers and no data are available from the fifo if read when the fifo is turned off there are essentially two options to use the device synchronous and reading synchronous readingin this mode the processor reads the data set bytes for axes configuration generated by the ic every time that is set the processor must read once and only once the data set in order to avoid data inconsistencies maxim integrated benefits of using this approach include the perfect of the signal coming from the gyroscope and minimum data traffic asynchronous readingin this mode the processor reads the data generated by the ic regardless the status of the flag to minimize the error caused by different samples being read different number of times the access frequency to be used must be much higher than the selected odr this approach normally requires much higher bw fifo normal modeoverrun

mode maxim integrated bias instability and angular random walkbias instability is critical performance parameter for gyroscopes the ic provides typical bias instability of on each axis and an arw of using the allan variance method based on the software management performed by an external processor the data capture data and interrupt generation features can be combined together data synchronizationthe dsync pin enables number of synchronization options featurethe dsync pin can be used to the ic from the or suspend mode repeatedly changing dsync from active to not active and can be used to control the power mode of the using an external controlling device be it microprocessor another sensor or different kind of device dsync can be configured to active either high or low and on either edge or level this feature is controlled by specific bit in the register data capture featureanother way to use the dsync pin is as data capture the ic can be configured to stop generating data until given edge occur on dsync once the programmed active edge occurs the ic collects as many data as in the register dsync mapping on datadsync can also be optionally mapped onto the lsb of the sensor data to perform synchronization afterwards the mapping occurs on every enabled axis of the this feature is controlled by specific bit in the register dsync interrupt generationthe dsync pin can also be used as an interrupt source to determine different kind of data synchronization unique serial numbereach ic is uniquely identified by bits that can be used to track the history of the sample including assembly and testing information revision idthe ic has register used to identify the revision id of the device and to identify the specific part number even though different part numbers may share the same value they would still be identified by means of different revision id values clockingthe pll locked to the gyroscope allows the odr within digital gyroscopes there are two dedicated bits in control register to enable the this feature can be used to verify if the gyroscope is working properly physically rotating the gyroscope that may be used either before or after it is assembled on pcb if the outputs are within the specified values in the data sheet then the gyroscope is working properly therefore the feature is an important in user mass production line the embedded in maxim digital is an additional key feature that allows the to be tested during final product assembly without requiring physical device movement maxim integrated register filethe register file is organized per banks on the common bank are mapped addresses from to and these registers are always available it is possible to map on addresses to two different user banks by properly programming address the purpose of this structure is to limit the management of the register map addresses in the to range even though the number of physical registers is in excess of common bankthe common is the bank whose

consumption data sheet theory of operation the is designed to sense and roll and pitch angular rate the operates on the principle of vibratory rate gyroscope figure presents simplified illustration of one of four coupled polysilicon sensing structures each sensing structure contains resonating disk that is electrostatically driven to resonance which produces the necessary rotating velocity element needed to generate coriolis torque when experiencing angular rate figure simplified gyroscope sensing structure when the sensing structure is exposed to an angular rate the resulting coriolis torque drives each of the disks into tilting motion which is sensed by plates under the disk the disk and plate form capacitive pickoff structure that senses angular rate the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the sensor design rejects linear and angular acceleration because external appear as signals that are removed by the fully differential architecture of the the resonator requires typical for operation because only is typically available in most applications switching regulator is included an external µf capacitor rated for is required for proper operation of the charge pump circuit after demodulation and conversion the rate signal is filtered using filter the and poles of this filter are programmable via the digital interface data sheet applications information application circuit the application circuit is shown in figure the primary communications port is the spi interface for this device external resistors are not required for the spi interface and these pins can be connected directly to the system microcontroller four capacitors are required for proper operation of the device for optimum device performance separate the capacitors placed on the vs vdd vreg and cp pins view terminal side down not to scale vdd spi bus figure recommended application circuit power supply decoupling in many applications bypass capacitors at vs vreg and vdd as shown in figure placed close to the supply pins adequately decouple the gyroscope from noise on the power supply however in applications where noise is present at the internal clock frequency or any harmonic thereof additional care in power supply bypassing is required because this noise may cause errors in angular rate measurement if additional decoupling is necessary resistor or ferrite bead in series with vs and an additional larger bypass capacitor µf or greater at vs may be helpful ensure that the connection from the ground to the power supply ground be low impedance because noise transmitted through ground has an effect similar to noise transmitted through power sequencing the interface voltage level is set with the interface supply voltage vdd which must be present to ensure that the does not create conflict on the communications bus for operation vdd can be the same as the main supply vs conversely in application vdd can differ from vs to accommodate the desired interface voltage when vs is applied the device enters standby state where power consumption is minimized and the device waits for vdd to be applied and for command to enter measurement mode measurement mode is activated by setting bit in register clear this bit to return the device to standby state in standby mode the current consumption is reduced to µa typical in standby mode only spi transactions are performed which includes reading from or writing to single register but does not include writing to or reading from several registers in one command in standby mode the gyroscope does not respond to rate outputs transition time to measurement mode where offsets settle to within of the final value is ms setting bandwidth the includes an internal configurable filter both the and poles of the filter are adjustable as shown in table and table the filter frequency response is shown in figure and figure the group delay of the wideband filter option is less than ms see figure for filter delay at the default condition for the filters is dc for the filter and hz for the filter table filter pole locations bit filter bit filter bit filter table filter pole locations bit bit filter filter bit filter bit filter data sheet frequency hz figure filter frequency response frequency hz figure filter frequency response offset preservation in the filter one of the functions of the filter is to remove offset the filter effectively estimates the offset and subtracts it from the output when the filter settings are changed the output remains unchanged the filter preserves its estimate of offset the filter can be set to the fast settling option allowed to converge to zero offset and then set to any other filter option while maintaining near zero offset exiting measurement mode clears the preserved offset analog evaluation mode an analog output evaluation mode has been incorporated in the in this mode the output of the is formatted as pulse density modulated data stream at frequency of khz via the pdmx and pdmy pins the pdmx and pdmy pins high and low voltage levels are ratiometric to vdd this signal can be decoded into an analog baseband using filter higher order filters allow for greater attenuation of the khz switching noise while maintaining the integrity of the baseband signal recommended application circuit with filter is shown in figure figure shows the recommended filter for demodulating the pdm output in analog mode operation view terminal side down not to scale vdd filter figure recommended application circuit for analog mode operation figure recommended filter for demodulating the pdm output in analog mode operation in analog mode the filter is disabled and the device can not be placed in standby mode spi communication to the is available but not required sensitivity in this mode is data sheet mechanical considerations for mounting mount the on the printed circuit board pcb in location close to hard mounting point of the pcb to the case mounting the at an unsupported pcb location as shown in figure may result in large apparent measurement errors due to undamped pcb vibration locating the near hard mounting point ensures that any pcb vibration at the device is above the resonant frequencies of the mems elements and therefore effectively invisible to the device in applications where the gyroscope may be subjected to large shock events or excessive vibration consider the use of damping materials such as polyurethane at the mounting locations to dampen the vibration thicker pcb can also help to reduce the effect of system resonance on the performance of the bad placement mounting points figure two examples of incorrectly mounted gyroscopes data sheet serial communications in digital mode the communicates via spi and operates as slave ignore data transmitted from the to the master device during writes to the wire the for spi communication as shown in the connection diagram in figure the maximum spi clock speed is mhz with pf maximum loading the timing scheme follows clock phase cpha clock polarity cpol figure spi connection cs is the serial port enable line and is controlled by the spi master it must go low at the start of transmissions and high at the end as shown in figure sclk is the serial port clock and is supplied by the spi master it is stopped high when cs is high during periods of no transmission at the rising edge of sclk data can be sampled unless the is in standby mode multiple bytes can be written to or read from in single transmission in standby mode only single register transactions are supported deasserting the cs pin is necessary between commands for transmissions with multiple commands for spi operation greater than mhz it is necessary to deassert the cs pin to ensure total delay of µs between the register addressing portion of the transmission the delay is required to allow settling of the internal voltage controlled oscillator for spi operation of mhz or lower the communication rate is low enough to ensure sufficient delay between register writes spi read and write operations are completed in or more clock cycles as shown in figure setting the bit to indicates read operation and setting it to indicates write operation for write data is written to the device in the register map based on the addresses for read is the data read by the external master device based on the addresses examples of spi write and read are shown in figure and figure figure

when the structure of data does not change during data acquisition in this case the number of storable frames can be maximized in contrast the header mode is intended for situations where flexibility in the data structure is required when the sensor runs at different odrs or when switching the sensor on or off during operation figure fifo frame configurations in headerless mode no header byte is used and the frames consist only of data bytes the data bytes will always be sensor data this mode has the advantage of an easy frame format and an optimized usage of the bytes of fifo storage it can be selected by disabling in register in case of overreading the fifo frames always contain the fixed expression magic number in the data frame in header mode every frame consists of header byte

terminated by stop signal generated by master the stop condition is low to high transition on sda line while scl is held high acks each byte of data transferred must be acknowledged it is indicated by an acknowledge bit sent by the receiver the transmitter must release the sda line no pull down during the acknowledge pulse while the receiver must then pull the sda line low so that it remains stable

registered trademarks of robert bosch gmbh germany note specifications within this document are preliminary and subject to change without notice data sheet write access write access can be used to write data byte in one sequence the sequence begins with start condition generated by the master followed by bits slave address and write bit rw the slave sends an acknowledge bit acks and releases the bus then the master sends the one byte register address the slave again acknowledges the transmission and waits for the bits of data which shall be written to the specified register address after the slave acknowledges the data byte the master generates stop signal and terminates the writing protocol example of an write access figure write read access read access also can be used to read one or multiple data bytes in one sequence read sequence consists of write phase followed by the read phase the two parts of the transmission must be separated by repeated start condition the write phase addresses the slave and sends the register address to be read after slave acknowledges the transmission the master generates again start condition and sends the slave address together with read bit rw then the master releases the bus and waits for the data bytes to be read out from slave after each data byte the master has to generate an acknowledge bit acks to enable further data transfer nackm acks from the master stops the data being transferred from the slave the slave releases the bus so that the master can generate stop condition and terminate the transmission the register address is automatically incremented and therefore more than one byte can be sequentially read out once new data read transmission starts the start address will be set to the register address specified since the latest write command by default the start address is set at in this way repetitive reads from the same starting address are possible in order to prevent the slave of the device to the bus watchdog

theory of operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyro figure shows simplified version of one of four polysilicon sensing structures each sensing structure contains dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance this produces the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force when experiencing angular rate the is designed to sense yaw angular rate when the sensing structure is exposed to angular rate the resulting coriolis force couples into an outer sense frame which contains movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers this forms capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the quad sensor design rejects linear and angular acceleration including external and vibration this is achieved by mechanically coupling the four sensing structures such that external appear as signals that can be removed by the fully differential architecture implemented in the figure simplified gyro sensing corner the electrostatic resonator requires to for operation because only are typically available in most applications charge pump is included on chip if an external to supply is available the two capacitors on to can be omitted and this supply can be connected to pin pin should not be grounded when power is applied to the no damage occurs but under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the setting bandwidth the external capacitor cout is used in combination with the resistor rout to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is and can be well controlled because rout has been trimmed during manufacturing to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and sumj pin results in in general an additional filter in either hardware or software is added to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the khz resonant frequency of the gyro an output filter consisting of series resistor and nf shunt capacitor khz pole is recommended figure shows the effect of adding this filter to the output of an set to hz bandwidth temperature output and calibration it is common practice to gyros to improve their overall accuracy the has temperature voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and its temperature coefficient therefore buffering the output is recommended the voltage at temp is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is at although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure supply ratiometricity the rateout and temp signals are ratiometric to the vratio voltage for example the null voltage rate sensitivity and temperature outputs are proportional to vratio therefore it is most easily used with adc which results in of errors due to minor supply variations there is some small usually negligible error due to nonratiometric behavior note that to guarantee full rate range vratio should not be greater than avcc data sheet modifying the measurement range mechanical performance the scale factor can be reduced to extend the measurement range to as much as by adding single kω resistor between the rateout and sumj if an external resistor is added between rateout and sumj cout must be proportionally reduced to maintain the correct bandwidth null adjustment the nominal null is for symmetrical swing range at rateout however nonsymmetric output swing may be suitable in some applications null adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may reflect some null instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case function the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics in the same manner as if subjected to angular rate it is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change about and causes an opposite change of the response follows the viscosity temperature dependence of the package atmosphere approximately activating both and simultaneously is not damaging and are fairly closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch and are activated by applying voltage equal to vratio to the pin and the pin the voltage applied to and must never be greater than avcc continuous the integration of the gives it higher reliability than is obtainable with any other high volume manufacturing method also it is manufactured under mature bimos process that has reliability as an additional failure detection measure can be performed however some applications may warrant continuous while sensing rate details outlining continuous techniques are also available in the application note the excellent vibration rejection is demonstrated in figure and figure figure shows the output response with and without rms hz to khz of random vibration the bandwidth of the gyro was limited to hz performance is similar regardless of the direction of the input vibration frequency hz figure output response with and without random vibration rms hz to khz figure demonstrates the dc noise response to sine vibration over the hz to khz range as can be seen there are no sensitive frequencies present and vibration rectification is vanishingly small as in

of the following key blocks and functions mems rate gyroscope sensor with adcs and signal conditioning primary and spi serial communications interfaces clocking sensor data registers fifo temperature sensor bias and ldos charge pump standard power modes mems gyroscope with adcs and signal conditioning the consists of three independent vibratory mems rate gyroscopes which detect rotation about the and axes when the gyros are rotated about any of the sense axes the coriolis effect causes vibration that is detected by capacitive pickoff the resulting signal is amplified demodulated and filtered to produce voltage that is proportional to the angular rate this voltage is digitized using individual converters adcs to sample each axis the range of the gyro sensors may be digitally programmed to and degrees per second dps the adc sample rate is programmable up to samples per second with filters that enable wide range of frequencies and spi serial communications interfaces the communicates to system processor using either spi or an serial interface the always acts as slave when communicating to the system processor the lsb of the slave address is set by pin solution using interface in the figure below the system processor is an master to the figure solution using interface solution using spi interface in the figure below the system processor is an spi master to the pins and are used to support the spc sdi sdo and cs signals for spi communications figure solution using spi interface allows for the testing of the mechanical and electrical portions of the sensors the for each measurement axis can be activated by means of the gyroscope registers registers and when the is activated the electronics cause the sensors to be actuated and produce an output signal the output signal is used to observe the response the response is defined as follows response sensor output with enabled sensor output with disabled the response for each gyroscope axis is defined in the gyroscope specification table when the value of the response is within the specified limits of the product specification the part has passed when the response exceeds the values the part is deemed to have failed it is recommended to use invensense motionapps software for executing for further information on please refer to the register map of clocking the has flexible clocking scheme allowing variety of internal clock sources to be used for the internal synchronous circuitry this synchronous circuitry includes the signal conditioning and adcs and various control circuits and registers an pll provides flexibility in the allowable inputs for generating this clock allowable internal sources for generating the internal clock are an internal relaxation oscillator between internal relaxation oscillator and gyroscope mems oscillator to use the best available source the only setting supporting specified performance in all modes is option it is recommended that option be used sensor data registers the sensor data registers contain the latest gyroscope and temperature measurement data they are registers and are accessed via the serial interface data from these registers may be read anytime fifo the contains fifo register that is accessible via the serial interface the fifo configuration register determines which data is written into the fifo possible choices include gyro data and temperature readings and fsync input fifo counter keeps track of how many bytes of valid data are contained in the fifo the fifo register supports burst reads the interrupt function may be used to determine when new data is available for further information regarding the fifo please refer to the register map of interrupts interrupt functionality is configured via the interrupt configuration register items that are configurable include the int pin configuration the interrupt latching and clearing method and triggers for the interrupt items that can trigger an interrupt are clock generator locked to new reference oscillator used when switching clock sources new data is available to be read from the fifo and data registers fifo overflow the interrupt status can be read from the interrupt status register temperature sensor an temperature sensor and adc are used to measure the die temperature the readings from the adc can be read from the fifo or the sensor data registers bias and ldos the bias and ldo section generates the internal supply and the reference voltages and currents required by the its two inputs are an unregulated vdd and vddio logic reference supply voltage the ldo output is bypassed by capacitor at regout for further details on the capacitor please refer to the bill of materials for external components charge pump an charge pump generates the high voltage required for the mems oscillator standard power modes the following table lists the power modes for mode name sleep mode standby mode drive on table standard power modes for power consumption for individual modes can be found in section sequence when applying vdd the power voltage ramp is detected and sequence is triggered inside the component during this phase the device starts operating and internal logic levels are defined for proper component initialization the should be performed with both cs and low ensuring that cs and scl pins are not in an undetermined state during the vdd ramp if starting in mode cs at logic high should be performed with low with high is not supported case and must be avoided it is worth noting that if the pins cs are between vil and vih when the sequence is triggered their value is undetermined and the internal logic levels may not be properly defined it should also be noted that vil and vih are related to vddio and their value changes at according to the applied vddio voltage ramp sequences that do not respect the conditions above may not lead to proper digital interface initialization in this case preliminary soft reset operation register set must be performed to reset the digital interface as soon as both vdd and vddio are stable at their final voltage since the digital interface may not be properly initialized the device may not provide the acknowledge signal if the protocol is used sensor initialization and clock source selection when sequence is completed as per section soft reset is required to initialize the sensor and let the device select the best clock source the soft reset must be performed by setting the register address to prior to registers initialization soft reset must be performed as first operation after the sequence to ensure the proper component registers setting correct whoami value is ensured only after the soft reset has been completed programmable interrupts the has programmable interrupt system which can generate an interrupt signal on the int pin status flags indicate the source of an interrupt interrupt sources may be enabled and disabled individually interrupt name fifo overflow data ready sensor registers table table of interrupt sources for information regarding the interrupt registers and flag registers please refer to the register map of in this document digital

voltage slave address lsb spi serial data output sdo scl spc serial clock scl spi serial clock spc sda sdi serial data sda spi serial data input sdi table serial interface to prevent switching into mode when using spi the interface should be disabled by setting the configuration bit setting this bit should be performed immediately after waiting for the time specified by the time for register in section for further information regarding the bit please refer to the register map of interface is interface comprised of the signals serial data sda and serial clock scl in general the lines are and in generalized interface implementation attached devices can be master or slave the master device puts the slave address on the bus and the slave device with the matching address acknowledges the master the always operates as slave device when communicating to the system processor which thus acts as the master sda and scl lines typically need resistors to vdd the maximum bus speed is khz the slave address of the is which is bits long the lsb bit of the address is determined by the logic level on pin this allows two to be connected to the same bus when used in this configuration the address of one of the devices should be pin is logic low and the address of the other should be pin is logic high communications protocol start and stop conditions communication on the bus starts when the master puts the start condition on the bus which is defined as transition of the sda line while scl line is high see figure below the bus is considered to be busy until the master puts stop condition on the bus which is defined as low to high transition on the sda line while scl is high see figure below additionally the bus remains busy if repeated start sr is generated instead of stop condition figure start and stop conditions data format acknowledge data bytes are defined to be bits long there is no restriction to the number of bytes transmitted per data transfer each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge ack signal the clock for the acknowledge signal is generated by the master while the receiver generates the actual acknowledge signal by pulling down sda and holding it low during the high portion of the acknowledge clock pulse if slave is busy and can not transmit or receive another byte of data until some other task has been performed it can hold scl low thus forcing the master into wait state normal data transfer resumes when the slave is ready and releases the clock line refer to the following figure figure acknowledge on the bus after beginning communications with the start condition the master sends slave address followed by an bit the bit the bit indicates whether the master is receiving data from or is writing to the slave device then the master releases the sda line and waits for the acknowledge signal ack from the slave device each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge bit to acknowledge the slave device pulls the sda line low and keeps it low for the high period of the scl line data transmission is always terminated by the master with stop condition thus freeing the communications line however the master can generate repeated start condition sr and address another slave without first generating stop condition low to high transition on the sda line while scl is high defines the stop condition all sda changes should take place when scl is low with the exception of start and stop conditions figure complete data transfer to write the internal registers the master transmits the start condition followed by the address and the write bit at the clock cycle when the clock is high the acknowledges the transfer then the master puts the register address ra on the bus after the acknowledges the reception of the register address the master puts the register data onto the bus this is followed by the ack signal and data transfer may be concluded by the stop condition to write multiple bytes after the last ack signal the master can continue outputting data rather than transmitting stop signal in this case the automatically increments the register address and loads the data to the appropriate register the following figures show single and write sequences write sequence master burst write sequence master to read the internal registers the master sends start condition followed by the address and write bit and then the register address that is going to be read upon receiving the ack signal from the the master transmits start signal followed by the slave address and read bit as result the sends an ack signal and the data the communication ends with not acknowledge nack signal and stop bit from master the nack condition is defined such that the sda line remains high at the clock cycle the following figures show single and read sequences read sequence master nack ack data burst read sequence master nack ack data terms signal description ad ack start condition sda goes from high to low while scl is high slave address write bit read bit acknowledge sda line is low while the scl line is high at the clock cycle nack sda line stays high at the clock cycle ra data internal register address transmit or received data stop condition sda going from low to high while scl is high table terms spi interface spi is synchronous serial interface that uses two control lines and two data lines the always operates as slave device during standard spi operation with respect to the master the serial clock output spc the serial data output sdo and the serial data input sdi are shared among the slave devices each spi slave device requires its own chip select cs line from the master cs goes low active at the start of transmission and goes back high inactive at the end only one cs line is active at time ensuring that only one slave is selected at any given time the cs lines of the slave devices are held high causing their sdo lines to remain in state so that they do not interfere with any active devices spi operational features data is delivered msb first and lsb last data is latched on the rising edge of spc data should be transitioned on the falling edge of spc the maximum frequency of spc is mhz spi read and write operations are completed in or more clock cycles two or more bytes the first byte contains the spi address and the following byte contain the spi data the first bit of the first byte contains the bit and indicates the read or write operation the following bits contain the register address in cases of data is two or more bytes supports single or

registers fifo interrupts mems gyroscope with adcs and signal conditioning both the and consist of single structure vibratory mems rate gyroscope which detects rotation about the or axes respectively when the gyro is rotated about any of the sense axes the coriolis effect causes vibration that is detected by capacitive pick off the resulting signal is amplified demodulated and filtered to produce voltage that is proportional to the angular rate this voltage is digitized using individual converters adcs to sample each axis the chip features programmable range of the gyro sensors of dps dps dps and dps the fsr range is optimized for image stabilization applications where the narrower range improves hand jitter detection accuracy via the bit adcs filters enable wide range of frequencies the adc sample rate can be programmed to khz khz khz hz hz hz hz hz hz or hz and spi serial communications interface the and have both and spi serial interfaces the device always acts as slave when communicating to the system processor the logic level for communications to the master is set by the voltage on the vddio pin the lsb of the of the slave address is set by the pin the and spi protocols are described in more detail in section internal clock generation both the and use flexible clocking scheme allowing for variety of internal clock sources for the internal synchronous circuitry this synchronous circuitry includes the signal conditioning and adcs various control circuits and registers allowable internal sources for generating the internal clock are an internal relaxation oscillator pll gyroscope based clock in order for the gyroscope to perform to spec the pll must be selected as the clock source when the internal mhz oscillator is chosen as the clock source the device can operate while having the gyroscopes disabled however this is only recommended if the user wishes to use the internal temperature sensor in this mode sensor data registers the sensor data registers contain the latest gyro and temperature data they are registers and are accessed via the serial interface data from these registers may be read anytime however the interrupt function may be used to determine when new data is available both the and contain fifo register that is accessible via the both the and spi serial interfaces the fifo configuration register determines what data goes into it with possible choices being gyro data temperature readings and fsync input fifo counter keeps track of how many bytes of valid data are contained in the fifo the fifo register supports burst reads the interrupt function may be used to determine when new data is available interrupt functionality is configured via the interrupt configuration register items that are configurable include the int pin configuration the interrupt latching and clearing method and triggers for the interrupt items that can trigger an interrupt are clock generator locked to new reference oscillator used when switching clock sources new data is available to be read from the fifo and data registers and fifo overflow the interrupt status can be read from the interrupt status register

description digital supply voltage slave address lsb spi serial data output sdo scl sclk serial clock scl spi serial clock sclk sda sdi serial data sda spi serial data input sdi interface is interface comprised of the signals serial data sda and serial clock scl in general the lines are and in generalized interface implementation attached devices can be master or slave the master device puts the slave address on the bus and the slave device with the matching address acknowledges the master both the and always operate as slave device when communicating to the system processor which thus acts as the master sda and scl lines typically need resistors to vdd the maximum bus speed is khz the slave address of the device is which is bits long the lsb bit of the address is determined by the logic level on pin this allows two or devices to be connected to the same bus when used in this configuration the address of the one of the devices should be pin is logic low and the address of the other should be pin is logic high the address is stored in register communications protocol start and stop conditions communication on the bus starts when the master puts the start condition on the bus which is defined as transition of the sda line while scl line is high see figure below the bus is considered to be busy until the master puts stop condition on the bus which is defined as low to high transition on the sda line while scl is high see figure additionally the bus remains busy if repeated start sr is generated instead of stop condition figure start and stop conditions data format acknowledge data bytes are defined to be bits long there is no restriction to the number of bytes transmitted per data transfer each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge ack signal the clock for the acknowledge signal is generated by the master while the receiver generates the actual acknowledge signal by pulling down sda and holding it low during the high portion of the acknowledge clock pulse if slave is busy and is unable to transmit or receive another byte of data until some other task has been performed it can hold scl low thus forcing the master into wait state normal data transfer resumes when the slave is ready and releases the clock line refer to figure figure acknowledge on the bus communications after beginning communications with the start condition the master sends slave address followed by an bit the bit the bit indicates whether the master is receiving data from or is writing to the slave device then the master releases the sda line and waits for the acknowledge signal ack from the slave device each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge bit to acknowledge the slave device pulls the sda line low and keeps it low for the high period of the scl line data transmission is always terminated by the master with stop condition thus freeing the communications line however the master can generate repeated start condition sr and address another slave without first generating stop condition low to high transition on the sda line while scl is high defines the stop condition all sda changes should take place when scl is low with the exception of start and stop conditions figure complete data transfer to write the internal or registers the master transmits the start condition followed by the address and the write bit at the clock cycle when the clock is high the device acknowledges the transfer then the master puts the register address ra on the bus after the device acknowledges the reception of the register address the master puts the register data onto the bus this is followed by the ack signal and data transfer may be concluded by the stop condition to write multiple bytes after the last ack signal the master can continue outputting data rather than transmitting stop signal in this case the device automatically increments the register address and loads the data to the appropriate register the following figures show single and write sequences write sequence master slave burst write sequence master slave to read the internal device registers the master sends start condition followed by the address and write bit and then the register address that is going to be read upon receiving the ack signal from the device the master transmits start signal followed by the slave address and read bit as result the device sends an ack signal and the data the communication ends with not acknowledge nack signal and stop bit from master the nack condition is defined such that the sda line remains high at the clock cycle the following figures show single and read sequences read sequence master slave burst read sequence master slave terms start condition sda goes from high to low while scl is high slave address write bit acknowledge sda line is low while the scl line is high at the clock cycle sda line stays high at the clock cycle the internal register address transmit or received data stop condition sda going from low to high while scl is high spi interface spi is synchronous serial interface that uses two control and two data lines both the and always operate as slave device during standard spi operation with respect to the master the serial clock output sclk the data output sdo and the data input sdi are shared among the slave devices the master generates an independent chip select for each slave device goes low at the start of transmission and goes back high at the end the serial data output sdo line remains in state when the device is not selected so it does not interfere with any active devices spi operational features data is delivered msb first and lsb last data is latched on rising edge of sclk data should be transitioned on the falling edge of sclk sclk frequency is mhz max for spi in full capability mode when the spi frequency is set to mhz its operation is limited to reading sensor registers only spi read and write operations are completed in or more clock cycles two or more bytes the first byte contains the spi address and the following byte contain the spi data the first bit of the first byte contains the bit and indicates the read or write operation the following bits contain the register address in cases of data is two or more bytes spi address format spi data format msb supports single or burst figure spi configuration each spi slave requires its own chip select line sdo sdi and sclk lines are shared only one line is active low at time ensuring that only one slave is selected at time the lines of other slaves are held high which causes their respective sdo pins to be serial interface considerations supported interfaces both the and support and spi communication logic levels the logic levels are set to vddio vddio may be set to be equal to

manufacturing to kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and sumj pin results in an additional external filter is often added in either hardware or software to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the khz resonant frequency of the gyroscope an rc output filter consisting of kω series resistor and nf shunt capacitor khz pole is recommended temperature output and calibration it is common practice to gyroscopes to improve their overall accuracy the has voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and its temperature coefficient therefore buffering the output is recommended the voltage at temp is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is typical at the output response over the full temperature range is shown in figure although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure theory of operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyroscope figure shows simplified version of one of four polysilicon sensing structures each sensing structure contains dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance this produces the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force when experiencing angular rate the is designed to sense yaw angular rate when the sensing structure is exposed to angular rate the resulting coriolis force couples into an outer sense frame which contains movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers this forms capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the quad sensor design rejects linear and angular acceleration including external shock and vibration the rejection is achieved by mechanically coupling the four sensing structures such that external appear as signals that can be removed by the fully differential architecture implemented in the figure simplified gyroscope sensing corner the electrostatic resonator requires for operation because only are typically available in most applications charge pump is included on chip if an external supply is available the two capacitors on to can be omitted and this supply can be connected to pin pin should not be grounded when power is applied to the no damage occurs but under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the data sheet supply ratiometricity continuous the integration of the as well as the mature process with which it is manufactured have provided the gyroscope with reliability as an additional failure detection measure can be performed at or occasionally during operation however some applications may require continuous while sensing rotation rate modifying the measurement range the scale factor can be reduced to extend the measurement range to as much as by adding single kω resistor between rateout and sumj if an external resistor is added between rateout and sumj cout must be proportionally increased to maintain correct bandwidth the null output voltage rateout sensitivity responses and and temperature output temp of the are ratiometric to vratio therefore using the with adc results in of errors resulting from minor supply variations there remains small usually negligible error due to behavior note that to guarantee full measurement range vratio should not be greater than avcc null adjustment the nominal null output voltage is true for symmetrical swing range at rateout however an asymmetric output swing may be suitable in some applications null adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may cause some null instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case function the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics in the same manner as if the gyroscope were subjected to angular rate is activated by applying the standard logic high level pin the pin or both applying logic high to pin causes the voltage at rateout to change by mv typical and applying logic high to pin causes an opposite change of mv typical the voltage applied to the and pins must never be greater than avcc the response follows the temperature dependence of the viscosity of the package atmosphere approximately activating both and simultaneously is not damaging the output responses generated by and are closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch data sheet immunity to vibration gyroscopes are designed to respond only to rotation however all gyroscopes respond to linear motion as well to varying degrees while bias stability is often used as the primary figure of merit for evaluating high performance gyroscopes many additional error sources are present in applications especially in applications that require motion sensors vibration and acceleration are present and the resulting errors often overwhelm bias drift its differential design makes the inherently resistant to vibration without the need for compensation the excellent vibration immunity of the is demonstrated in figure and figure figure shows the output response with and without random rms vibration applied at hz to khz performance is similar regardless of the direction of input vibration with vibration no vibration frequency hz figure output response with and without random vibration rms hz to khz gyroscope bandwidth set to hz to further improve immunity to vibration and acceleration some compensation can be performed using an accelerometer this technique is most successful when the response to vibration is constant regardless of vibration frequency figure demonstrates the dc bias response to sinusoidal vibration over the hz to khz range this figure shows that there are no sensitive frequencies present and that vibration rectification is vanishingly small accordingly compensation using an accelerometer is possible where needed but the inherent device

information the calibration information is encoded into the device during factory test the calibration data is used to perform offset gain and over temperature by storing this information internally the eliminates the need for the customer to perform system level temperature calibration mechanical considerations for mounting mount the in location close to hard mounting point of the pcb mounting the at an unsupported pcb location that is at the end of lever or in the middle of trampoline as shown in figure can result in apparent errors because the gyroscope is subject to the resonant vibration of the pcb locating the gyroscope near hard mounting point helps to ensure that any pcb resonances at the gyroscope are above the frequency at which harmful aliasing with the internal electronics can occur to ensure that aliased signals do not couple into the baseband measurement range design the module so that the first system level resonance occurs at frequency higher than hz

the to bits are the device data which can contain any of the following data from the master to be written to memory register as specified by the to bits sensor rate output data from the slave device

are updated asynchronously depending on their respective detection criteria however it is recommended that the fault registers be read at rate of at least hz when asserted an individual status bit is not deasserted until it is read by the master device if the error persists after fault register read the status bit is immediately reasserted and remains asserted until the next sequential exchange

asserted when the st bits are set to see the and bits section assertion of the fail bit indicates that the device has experienced gross failure and that the sensor data could be invalid amp bit the amp fault bit is asserted when the measured amplitude of the silicon resonator has been significantly reduced this condition can occur if the voltage supplied to falls below the requirements of the internal voltage regulator this fault bit is or ed with the cst fault bit therefore during sensor data request the cst bit position represents either an amp failure or cst failure the full fault register can be read from memory to determine the specific failure ov bit the ov fault bit is asserted if the internally regulated voltage nominally is observed to exceed this measurement is filtered to prevent artifacts such as noise spikes from asserting fault condition when an ov fault occurs the pwr fault bit is asserted simultaneously because the ov fault bit is not transmitted as part of sensor data response it is recommended that the user read back the and memory registers upon the assertion of pwr error to determine the specific error condition the uv fault bit is asserted if the internally regulated voltage nominally is observed to be less than this is filtered to prevent artifacts such as noise spikes from asserting fault condition when uv fault occurs the pwr fault bit is asserted simultaneously because the uv fault bit is not transmitted as part of sensor data response it is recommended that the user read back the and memory registers upon the assertion of pwr error to determine the specific error condition pll bit the pll bit indicates that the device has experienced failure in the loop functional circuit block this occurs when the pll fails to achieve synchronization with the resonator structure if the pll status flag is active the st bits of the sensor data response are set to indicating that the response contains potentially invalid rate data bit fault is asserted based on two independent quadrature calculations the quad memory register address contains value corresponding to the total instantaneous quadrature present in the device if this value exceeds lsb fault is issued an internal quadrature accumulator records the amount of quadrature correction performed by the fault is issued when the quadrature error present in the device has contributed to an equivalent of typical of rate offset nvm bit an nvm error is transmitted to the control module when the internal nonvolatile memory data fails checksum calculation this check is performed once every μs and does not include the pidx memory registers por bit an internal check is performed on device startup to ensure that the volatile memory of the device is functional this is by programming known value from the device rom into volatile memory register this value is then continuously compared to the known value in rom every μs for the duration of the device operation if the value stored in the volatile memory changes or does not match the value stored in rom the por error flag is asserted the value stored in rom is rewritten to the volatile memory upon device power cycle data sheet pwr bit the device performs continuous check of the internal regulated voltage level if either an overvoltage ov or uv fault is asserted the pwr bit is also asserted this condition occurs if the regulated voltage is observed to be either above or below an internal filter removes high frequency glitching effects to prevent the pwr bit from being asserted unnecessarily to determine whether the fault is result of an overvoltage or undervoltage condition the ov and uv fault bits must be read cst bit the is designed with continuous the measured amplitudes are compared to the limits presented in table deviations from these values result in reported errors the two thresholds for failure are as follows value lsb from nominal results in the assertion of the flag in the fault register value lsb from nominal results in the assertion of the flag in the fault register and the setting of the st bits to indicating that the rate data contained in the sensor data response is potentially invalid chk bit the chk bit is transmitted by the control module to the as method of generating faults by asserting the chk bit the device creates conditions that result in the of all faults represented in the fault registers for example the amplitude is deliberately altered to exceed the fault detection threshold resulting in error in this way the device is capable of checking both its ability to detect fault condition and its ability to report that fault condition to the control module the fault conditions are initiated nearly simultaneously the timing for receiving fault codes when the chk bit is asserted depends on the time required to generate each unique fault it takes no more than ms for all internal faults to be generated and the fault register to be updated to reflect the condition of the device until the chk bit is cleared the status bits st are set to indicating that the data should be interpreted by the control module as data after the chk bit is deasserted an additional ms are required for the fault conditions to decay and for the device to return to normal operation see the recommended sequence with chk bit assertion section for the proper methodology for asserting the chk bit data sheet recommended sequence with chk bit assertion figure illustrates recommended sequence that can be implemented by the user alternate sequences can be used but the response from the must be handled correctly if the sequence is implemented immediately after power is applied to the device the total time to implement the following fault detection routine is approximately as described in the device data latching section the data present in the device upon the assertion of the cs signal is used in the next sequential exchange this results in an apparent delay before the data resulting from the assertion of the chk bit is reported by the device for all other interactions with the device no such delay exists and the mosi command is serviced during the next sequential exchange note that if the chk bit is deasserted and the user tries to obtain data from the device before the cst fault flag clears the device reports the data as error data mosi sensor

internal clock generation both the and use flexible clocking scheme allowing for variety of internal clock sources for the internal synchronous circuitry this synchronous circuitry includes the signal conditioning and adcs various control circuits and registers allowable internal sources for generating the internal clock are an internal relaxation oscillator pll gyroscope based clock in order for

serial data sda and serial clock scl in general the lines are and in generalized interface implementation attached devices can be master or slave the master device puts the slave address on the bus and the slave device with the matching address acknowledges the master both the and always operate as slave device when communicating to the system processor which thus acts as the master sda and scl lines typically need resistors to vdd the maximum bus speed is khz the slave address of the device is which is bits long the lsb bit of the bit address is determined by the logic level on pin this allows two or devices to be connected to the same bus when used in this configuration the address of the one of the devices should be pin is logic low and the address of the other should be pin is logic high the address is stored in register communications protocol start and stop conditions communication on the bus starts when the master puts the start condition on the bus which is defined as transition of the sda line while scl line is high see figure below the bus is considered to be busy until the master puts stop condition on the bus which is defined as low to high transition on the sda line while scl is high see figure below additionally the bus remains busy if repeated start sr is generated instead of stop condition start and stop conditions confidential proprietary product specification data format acknowledge data bytes are defined to be bits long there is no restriction to the number of bytes transmitted per data transfer each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge ack signal the clock for the acknowledge signal is generated by the master while the receiver generates the actual acknowledge signal by pulling down sda and holding it low during the high portion of the acknowledge clock pulse if slave is busy and is unable to transmit or receive another byte of data until some other task has been performed it can hold scl low thus forcing the master into wait state normal data transfer resumes when the slave is ready and releases the clock line refer to the following figure acknowledge on the bus communications after beginning communications with the start condition the master sends slave address followed by an bit the bit the bit indicates whether the master is receiving data from or is writing to the slave device then the master releases the sda line and waits for the acknowledge signal ack from the slave device each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge bit to acknowledge the slave device pulls the sda line low and keeps it low for the high period of the scl line data transmission is always terminated by the master with stop condition thus freeing the communications line however the master can generate repeated start condition sr and address another slave without first generating stop condition low to high transition on the sda line while scl is high defines the stop condition all sda changes should take place when scl is low with the exception of start and stop conditions complete data transfer confidential proprietary product specification to write the internal or registers the master transmits the start condition followed by the address and the write bit at the clock cycle when the clock is high the device acknowledges the transfer then the master puts the register address ra on the bus after the device acknowledges the reception of the register address the master puts the register data onto the bus this is followed by the ack signal and data transfer may be concluded by the stop condition to write multiple bytes after the last ack signal the master can continue outputting data rather than transmitting stop signal in this case the device automatically increments the register address and loads the data to the appropriate register the following figures show single and write sequences write sequence master slave burst write sequence master slave to read the internal device registers the master sends start condition followed by the address and write bit and then the register address that is going to be read upon receiving the ack signal from the device the master transmits start

addition gyroscopes sense mechanical stress coming from the printed circuit board pcb this pcb stress can be minimized by adhering to certain design rules when using mems gyroscope components in plastic packages pcb mounting and assembly can cause package stress this package stress in turn can affect the output offset and its value over wide range of temperatures this stress is caused by the mismatch between the coefficient of linear thermal expansion cte of the package material and the pcb care must be taken to avoid package stress due to mounting traces connected to pads should be as symmetric as possible maximizing symmetry and balance for pad connection will help component self alignment and will lead to better control of solder paste reduction after reflow any material used in the surface mount assembly process of the mems gyroscope should be free of restricted rohs elements or compounds solders should be used for assembly exposed die pad precautions the and have very low active and standby current consumption there is no electrical connection between the exposed die pad and the internal cmos circuits the exposed die pad is not required for and should not be soldered to the pcb underfill is also not recommended soldering or adding underfill to the can induce performance changes due to package stress trace routing routing traces or vias under the gyro package such that they run under the exposed die pad is prohibited routed active signals may harmonically couple with the gyro mems devices compromising gyro response the gyro drive frequency is khz to avoid harmonic coupling don route active signals in signal planes directly below or above the gyro package note for best performance design ground plane under the to reduce pcb signal noise from the board on which the gyro device is mounted if the gyro device is stacked under another pcb board design ground plane directly above the gyro device to shield active signals from the pcb board mounted above component placement do not place large insertion components such as keyboard or similar buttons connectors or shielding boxes at distance of less than mm from the mems gyro maintain generally accepted industry design practices for component placement near the or to prevent noise coupling and stress pcb mounting and sensitivity orientation errors of the gyroscope as mounted to the printed circuit board can cause sensitivity in which one gyro sense axis responds to rotation or acceleration about an orthogonal axis for example the sense axis may respond to rotation about the or axes the orientation mounting errors are illustrated in the figure on the next page dependent on xy or xz configurations confidential proprietary product specification the table below shows the sensitivity as

contain dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance producing the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force during angular rate at two of the outer extremes of each frame orthogonal to the dither motion are movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers to form capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the design rejects external forces and vibration fabricating the sensor with the signal conditioning electronics preserves signal integrity in noisy environments the electrostatic resonator requires to for operation because only are typically available in most applications charge pump is included if an external

under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the setting bandwidth external capacitor cout is used in combination with the rout resistor to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is and can be well controlled because rout is trimmed during manufacture to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and sumj pin results in in general an additional hardware or software filter is added to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the gyro khz resonant frequency the noise spikes at khz can be clearly seen in the power spectral density curve shown in figure typically this additional filter corner frequency is set to greater than the required to preserve good phase response figure shows the effect of adding hz filter to the output of an set to hz bandwidth as shown in figure high frequency demodulation artifacts are attenuated by approximately db figure noise spectral density with additional hz filter temperature output and calibration it is common practice to gyros to improve their overall accuracy the has temperature proportional voltage output that provides input to such calibration method the temperature sensor structure is shown in figure the temperature output is characteristically nonlinear and any load resistance connected to the temp output results in decreasing the temp output and temperature coefficient therefore buffering the output is recommended the voltage at the temp pin is nominally at and vratio the temperature coefficient is at although the temp output is highly repeatable it has only modest absolute accuracy figure temperature sensor structure calibrated performance using calibration technique it is possible to calibrate the null and sensitivity drift of the to an overall accuracy of nearly an overall accuracy of or better is possible using more points limiting the bandwidth of the device reduces the noise during the calibration process improving the accuracy at each calibration point and supply ratiometricity the rateout and temp signals are ratiometric to the vratio voltage that is the null voltage rate sensitivity and temperature outputs are proportional to vratio thus the is most easily used with adc that results in of errors due to minor supply variations there is some small error due to nonratiometric behavior typical ratiometricity error for null sensitivity and temperature output is outlined in table note that vratio must never be greater than avcc table ratiometricity error for various parameters parameter mean sigma mean sigma mean sigma sensitivity mean sigma mean sigma null adjustment the nominal null is for symmetrical swing range at rateout however nonsymmetrical output swing may be suitable in some applications null adjustment is possible by injecting suitable current to sumj note that supply disturbances may reflect some null instability digital supply noise should be avoided particularly in this case function the includes feature that actuates each of the sensing structures and associated electronics as if subjected to angular rate the feature is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change about and causes an opposite change of the response follows the viscosity temperature dependence of the package atmosphere approximately activating both and simultaneously is not damaging and are fairly closely matched but actuating both simultaneously may result in small apparent null bias shift proportional to the degree of mismatch and are activated by applying voltage of greater than vratio to the and pins and are deactivated by applying voltage of less than vratio to the and pins the voltage applied to and must never be greater than avcc continuous the integration of the gives it higher reliability than is obtainable with any other high

the operates on the principle of resonator simplified version of one of four polysilicon sensing structures is shown in figure each sensing structure contains dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance this produces the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force when experiencing angular rate in the package the is designed to sense yaw angular rate whereas the vertical mount package orients the device such that it can sense pitch or roll angular rate on the same pcb when the sensing structure is exposed to angular rate the resulting coriolis force couples into an outer sense frame which contains movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers this forms capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the quad sensor design rejects linear and angular acceleration including external and vibration this is achieved by mechanically coupling the four sensing structures such that external appear as signals that can be removed by the fully differential architecture implemented in the continuous the gyroscope uses complete electromechanical an electrostatic force is applied to the gyroscope frame resulting in deflection of the capacitive sense fingers this deflection is exactly equivalent to deflection that occurs as result of external rate input the output from the beam structure is processed by the same signal chain as true rate output signal providing complete coverage of the electrical and mechanical components the electromechanical is performed continuously during operation at rate higher than the output bandwidth of the device the routine generates equivalent positive and negative rate deflections this information can then be filtered with no overall effect on the demodulated rate output rate signal withcontinuous self test signal figure simplified gyroscope sensing structure the

magnitudes the cst bit of the fault register is asserted however the status bits st in the sensor data response remain set to for valid sensor data for more severe errors the cst bit of the fault is asserted and the status bits st in the sensor data response are set to for invalid sensor data table lists the thresholds for both of these failure conditions if desired the user can access the information by issuing read command to the memory register address for more about error reporting see the spi communication protocol section data sheet applications information mechanical considerations for mounting mount the in location close to hard mounting point of the pcb to the case mounting the at an unsupported pcb location that is at the end of lever or in the middle of trampoline as shown in figure can result in apparent measurement errors because the gyroscope is subject to the resonant vibration of the pcb locating the gyroscope near hard mounting point helps to ensure that any pcb at the gyroscope are above the frequency at which harmful aliasing with the internal electronics can occur to ensure that aliased signals do not couple into the baseband measurement range design the module wherein the first system level resonance occurs at frequency higher than hz mounting points figure incorrectly placed gyroscope applications circuits figure and

indicating that the device has had failure in the loop functional circuit block this occurs when the pll has failed to achieve sync with the resonator structure if the pll status flag is active the st bits of the sensor data response are set to indicating that the response contains potentially invalid rate data fault can be asserted based on two independent quadrature calculations located in the quad memory register is value corresponding to the total instantaneous quadrature present in the device if this value exceeds lsb fault is issued because quadrature can contribute to an offset error the has integrated methods for dynamically cancelling the effects of quadrature an internal quadrature accumulator records the amount of quadrature correction performed by the excessive quadrature is associated with offset errors fault is issued when the quadrature error present in the device has contributed to an equivalent of typical of rate offset nvm an nvm error transmits to the control module when the internal nvm data fails checksum calculation this check is performed once every µs and does not include the or pid memory registers por an internal check is performed at the time of device startup to ensure that the volatile memory of the device is functional this is accomplished by programming known value from the device rom into volatile memory register this value is then compared to the known value in rom every µs for the duration of device operation if the value stored in the volatile memory changes or does not match the value stored in rom the por error flag is asserted the value stored in rom is rewritten to the volatile memory upon device power cycle pwr the device performs continuous check of the internal regulated voltage level if either an overvoltage ov or uv fault is asserted then the power pwr bit is also asserted this condition occurs if the regulated voltage is observed to be either above or below an internal filter removes high frequency glitching effects to prevent the pwr bit from asserting unnecessarily to determine if the fault is result of an overvoltage or undervoltage condition the ov and uv fault bits must be analyzed cst the is designed with continuous cst functionality measured amplitudes are compared against the limits presented in table deviations from this value are what result in reported errors there are two thresholds for failure value lsb from nominal results in an assertion of the flag in the fault register value lsb from nominal results in both an assertion of the flag in the fault register as well as setting the st bits to indicating that the rate data contained in the sensor data response is potentially invalid chk the control module transmits the check chk bit to the as method of generating faults by asserting the chk bit the device creates conditions that result in the generation of all faults represented through the fault register for example the amplitude is deliberately altered to exceed the fault detection threshold resulting in error in this way the device is capable of checking both its ability to detect fault condition as well as its ability to report that fault to the control module the fault conditions are initiated nearly simultaneously however the timing for receiving fault codes when the chk bit is asserted is dependent upon the time required to generate each unique fault it takes no more than ms for all of the internal faults to be generated and for the fault register to be updated to reflect the condition of the device until the chk bit is cleared the status bits st are set to indicating that the data should be interpreted by the control module as data after the chk bit is deasserted the fault conditions require an additional ms to decay and the device to return to normal operation data sheet ov the overvoltage ov fault bit asserts if the internally regulated voltage nominally is observed to exceed this is filtered to prevent artifacts such as noise spikes from asserting fault condition when an ov fault has occurred the pwr fault bit is asserted simultaneously because the ov fault bit is not transmitted as part of sensor data request it is recommended that the user read back the and memory registers upon the assertion of pwr error this allows the user to determine the specific error condition uv the undervoltage uv fault bit asserts if the internally voltage nominally is observed to be less than this measurement is filtered to prevent artifacts such as noise spikes from asserting fault condition when uv fault has occurred the pwr fault bit is asserted simultaneously as the uv fault bit is not transmitted as part of sensor data request it is recommended that the user read back the and memory registers upon the assertion of pwr error this allows the user to determine the specific error condition fail the fail flag is asserted when condition arises such that the st bits are set to this indicates that the device has experienced gross failure and that the sensor data could potentially be invalid amp the amp fault bit is asserted when the measured amplitude of the silicon resonator has been significantly reduced this can occur if the voltage supplied to has fallen below the requirements of the internal voltage regulator this fault bit is or ed with the cst fault such that during sensor data request the cst bit position represents either an amp failure or cst failure the full status register can then be read from memory to validate the specific failure assertion recommended routine figure illustrates recommended routine that can be implemented by the user alternate sequences can be employed however ensure that the response from the is handled correctly if implemented immediately after power is applied to the device the total time to implement the following fault detection routine is approximately as described in the device data latching section the data present in the device upon the assertion of the cs signal is used in the next sequential exchange this results in an apparent one transaction delay before the data resulting from the assertion of the chk command is reported by the device for all other interactions with the device no such delay exists and the mosi command is serviced during the next sequential exchange note that when the chk bit is deasserted if the user tries to obtain data from the device before the cst fault flag has cleared the device reports the data as error data data sheet mosi sensor data requestchk command asserted miso standard initialresponse

overview the core angular rate sensor integrated inside the is based on the analog devices imems technology this sensor operates on the principle of resonator gyroscope two polysilicon sensing structures each contain dither frame electrostatically driven to resonance this provides the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force during rotation at two of the outer extremes of each frame orthogonal to the dither motion are movable fingers placed between fixed fingers to form capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the base sensor output signal is sampled using an adc and then the digital data is fed into proprietary digital calibration circuit this circuit contains calibration coefficients from the factory calibration along with calibration registers that can be used to calibrate errors the calibrated gyroscope data is made available through output data registers along with temperature power supply auxiliary adc and relative angle output calculations relative angle estimate the register offers the integration of the data in order for this information to be useful the reference angle must be known this can be accomplished by reading the register contents at the initial time before starting the monitoring or by setting its contents to zero this number is reset to zero when the null command is used after reset command is used and during this function can be used to estimate change in angle over period the user is cautioned to fully understand the stability requirements and the time period over which to use this estimated relative angle position factory calibration the provide factory calibration that includes correction for initial tolerance and power supply variation in addition the provides correction for temperature variation this calibration includes individual sensor characterization and custom correction coefficient calculation auxiliary adc function the auxiliary adc function integrates standard adc into the to digitize other analog signals the output of the adc can be monitored through the control register as defined in table the adc is successive approximation converter the output data is presented in straight binary format with the range extending from to the upper limit is derived from the precision internal reference figure shows the equivalent circuit of the analog input structure of the adc the input capacitor is typically pf and can be attributed to parasitic package capacitance the two diodes provide esd protection for the analog input care must be taken to ensure that the analog input signals never exceed the range of to this causes the diodes to become and to start conducting the diodes can handle ma without causing irreversible damage the resistor is lumped component that represents the on resistance of the switches the value of this resistance is typically capacitor represents the adc sampling capacitor and is typically pf figure equivalent analog input circuit conversion phase switch open track phase switch closed for ac applications it is recommended to remove high frequency components from the analog input signal by using filter on the analog input pin in applications where harmonic distortion and ratio are critical the analog input must be driven from low impedance source large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance of the adc this can necessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier when no input amplifier is used to drive the analog input the source impedance should be limited to values lower than kω basic operation the are designed for simple integration into industrial system designs requiring only power supply and industry standard serial peripheral interface spi all outputs and functions are handled by simple register structure each register is bits in length and has its own unique bit map the bits in each register consist of an upper to byte and lower to byte each of which has its own address serial peripheral interface spi the serial peripheral interface spi port includes four signals chip select cs serial clock sclk data input din and data output dout the cs line enables the spi port and frames each spi event which consists of single or multiple data frames when this signal is high the dout lines are in high impedance state and the signals on din and sclk have no impact on operation complete data frame contains clock cycles because the spi port operates in full duplex mode it supports simultaneous receive din and transmit dout functions during the same data frame refer to table figure and figure for detailed timing and operation of the spi port writing to registers figure displays typical data frame for writing command to control register in this case the first bit of the din sequence is followed by the address and the data command because each write command covers single byte of data two data frames are required when writing the entire space of register reading from registers reading the contents of register requires modification to the sequence in figure in this case the first two bits in the din sequence are followed by the address of the register each register has two addresses upper lower but either one can be used to access its entire bits of data the final eight bits of the din sequence are irrelevant and can be counted as don cares during read command during the next data frame the dout sequence contains the register data as shown in figure although single read command requires two separate data frames the full duplex mode minimizes this overhead requiring only one extra data frame when continuously sampling data frame register

latch and software reset each of these global commands has unique control bit assigned to it in the command register and is initiated by writing to its assigned bit the function does two things it resets the contents of the register to zero and it adjusts the register to zero this automated adjustment takes two steps read write the opposite of this value into the register sensor noise influences the accuracy of this step for optimal calibration accuracy set the number of filtering taps to its maximum wait for the appropriate number of samples to process through the filter and then exercise this option the factory calibration restore command sets the contents of to and to erasing any calibration contents the manual flash update writes the contents of each nonvolatile register into flash memory for storage this process takes approximately ms and requires the power supply voltage to be within specification for the duration of the event it is worth noting that this operation also automatically follows the and factory reset commands the dac latch command loads the contents of into the dac latches since the contents must be updated one byte at time this command ensures

analog input circuit conversion phase switch open track phase switch closed for ac applications it is recommended to remove high components from the analog input signal by using filter on the analog input pin in applications where harmonic distortion and ratio are critical the analog input must be driven from low impedance source large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance of the adc this can necessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier when no input amplifier is used to drive the analog input the source impedance should be limited to values lower than kω basic operation the is designed for simple integration into system designs requiring only power supply and industry standard serial peripheral interface spi all outputs and functions are handled by simple register structure each register is bits in length and has its own unique bit map the bits in each register consist of an upper byte bit to bit and lower byte bit to bit each of which has its own address serial peripheral interface spi the spi port includes four signals chip select cs serial clock sclk data input din and data output dout the cs line enables the spi port and frames each spi event when this signal is high the dout lines are in high impedance state and the signals on din and sclk have no impact on operation complete data frame contains clock cycles because the spi port operates in full duplex mode it supports simultaneous receive din and transmit dout functions during the same data frame see table figure and figure for detailed timing and operation of the spi port writing to registers figure displays typical data frame for writing command to control register in this case the first bit of the din sequence is followed by the address and the data because each write command covers single byte of data two data frames are required when writing to the entire space of register reading from registers reading the contents of register requires modification to the sequence in figure in this case the first two bits in the din sequence are followed by the address of the register each register has two addresses upper and lower but either one can be used to access its entire bits of data the final eight bits of the din sequence are irrelevant and can be counted as don cares during read command during the next data frame the dout sequence contains the register

and several configuration features set of communication and configuration registers govern the operation in the see table for summary of these registers quick start the spi operates in segments the first byte of spi sequence goes into the com register which contains the control bit and the address of the target register when writing information into control registers the next byte contains the configuration information when reading output data the next one to three bytes contain the contents of the register selected configuration sequence the sequence in table provides the recommended configuration sequence table and figure provide the timing information for each segment of this configuration sequence for additional information on design and optimization with the see the application note table configuration sequence step register com iop purpose start write sequence for iop configure the signal to pulse low when the ratedata and tempdata output registers contain new

register initialize the rate conversion start write sequence for the tempcs register enable and configure the temperature data channel start write sequence for tempconv initialize the temp conversion start write sequence for the mode register establish the data output resolution to bits and start the conversion process with the ratedata channel tempconv com reading rate output data after the configuration sequence in table is complete reading the output data is very simple the converts the rate and temp data continuously to better understand this process figure provides an example read sequence and table and figure provide critical timing details for the output signal the first byte of the sequence uses sdi to establish read of the rate output register this is accomplished by writing to the com register the most significant byte is first in the sdo sequence followed by the next significant and then the least significant when resolution is in use only two bytes are output from the sdo during the read sequence figure read sequence example figure the signal rdy indicates that unread data is available on both rate and temp output registers after the rate or temp channel is read the signal returns high as shown in the rate and temp channels update sequentially and each has sample rate of ksps the internal sample rate is not dependent on the spi signals or read rates using the signal to drive data collection helps avoid losing data due to data collision which is when read cycle coincides with the internal update time in this case the old data remains and the new data is lost if lower sample rate meets requirements the signal can still be useful in facilitating spi read sequences in this case the signal pulses high for approximately μs before returning low and then repeats this pattern at two times the internal sample rate this signal can feed counter circuit or firmware which drives processor interrupt routine at reduced sample rate reading temp output data reading temp data requires sequence that is very similar to that of figure except that the initial sdi sequence must be changed from to if the temp data is not used step to step of the configuration sequence are not required the sdi column lists the hexadecimal code representation of the sdi bit input sequence data format the uses the offset binary data format configuration options synchronization input the sync pin can be used to synchronize the with other devices in the system when the sync bit in the port register iop is set and the sync pin is low the does not process any conversions instead it waits until the sync pin goes high and then starts the operation this allows the conversion to start from known point in time for example the rising edge of the sync pin function the function enables diagnostic checks for the entire conditioning circuit to activate the function there must be logic high signal on all st pins see table when activated the function

operation the operates on the principle of resonator gyro two polysilicon sensing structures each contain dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance producing the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force during angular rate at two of the outer extremes of each frame orthogonal to the dither motion are movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers to form capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the design rejects

note that should not be grounded when power is applied to the although no damage occurs under certain conditions the charge pump may fail to start up after the ground is removed without first removing power from the setting bandwidth external capacitor cout is used in combination with the rout resistor to create filter to limit the bandwidth of the rate response the db frequency set by rout and cout is and can be well controlled because rout has been trimmed during manufacturing to be kω any external resistor applied between the rateout pin and sumj pin results in in general an additional hardware or software filter is added to attenuate high frequency noise arising from demodulation spikes at the gyro khz resonant frequency the noise spikes at khz can be clearly seen in the power spectral density curve shown in figure typically this additional filter corner frequency is set to greater than the required bandwidth to preserve good phase response figure shows the effect of adding hz filter to the output of an set to hz bandwidth as shown in figure high frequency demodulation artifacts are attenuated by approximately db and supply ratiometricity the rateout and temp signals are ratiometric to the vratio voltage that is the null voltage rate sensitivity and temperature outputs are proportional to vratio thus the is most easily used with adc that results in of errors due to

associated electronics as if subjected to angular rate it is activated by standard logic high levels applied to input input or both causes the voltage at rateout to change about and causes an opposite

polysilicon sensing structures each sensing structure contains dither frame that is electrostatically driven to resonance this produces the necessary velocity element to produce coriolis force when experiencing angular rate the is designed to sense yaw angular rate when the sensing structure is exposed to angular rate the resulting coriolis force is coupled into an outer sense frame which contains movable fingers that are placed between fixed pickoff fingers this forms capacitive pickoff structure that senses coriolis motion the resulting signal is fed to series of gain and demodulation stages that produce the electrical rate signal output the design rejects linear and angular acceleration including external and vibration this is achieved by mechanically coupling the four sensing structures such that external appear as signals that can be removed by the fully differential architecture implemented in the figure simplified gyro sense structure the resonator requires

this supply can be connected to see the application circuit section continuous the gyroscope uses complete electromechanical an electrostatic force is applied to the gyroscope frame resulting in deflection of the capacitive sense fingers this deflection is exactly equivalent to deflection that occurs as result of the external rate input the output from the beam structure is processed by the same signal chain as true rate output signal providing complete coverage of both the electrical and mechanical components the electromechanical is performed continuously during operation at rate higher than the output bandwidth of the device the routine generates equivalent positive and negative rate deflections this information can then be filtered such that there is no overall effect on the demodulated rate output rate signal withcontinuous signal amplitude internallycompared to the specificationtable limits low frequency rate information figure continuous demodulation the difference amplitude between the positive and negative deflections is filtered to hz and monitored and compared to hardcoded limits if the measured amplitude exceeds these limits listed in the specifications table one of two error conditions is asserted depending on the magnitude of error for less severe error magnitudes the cst bit of the fault register is asserted however the status bits st in the sensor data response remain set to for valid sensor data for more severe errors the cst bit of the fault register is asserted and the status bits st in the sensor data response are set to for invalid

communication section for more information about error reporting data sheet applications information calibrated performance each gyroscope uses internal eeprom memory to store its temperature calibration information the calibration information is encoded into the device during factory testing the calibration data is used to perform offset gain and test corrections over temperature storing

point of the printed circuit board pcb to the case mounting the at an unsupported pcb location that is at the end of lever or in the middle of trampoline as shown in figure may result in apparent measurement errors because the gyroscope is subject to the resonant vibration of the pcb locating the gyroscope near hard mounting point helps ensure that any pcb resonances at the gyroscope are above

correct synchronization the gyroscope includes the sq field in the response as it was received in the request sensor module bits from the master device these bits are not implemented in the but are hardcoded to for all occurrences these bits represent the memory address from which device data is read or to which information is written these bits should be supplied by the master only when the memory registers are being accessed and are ignored for all sensor data requests see the memory register definitions section for complete description of the available memory registers data sheet content in bits error data for sensor data response valid sensor data sensor data response there are two independent conditions that can result in the st bits being set to during sensor data response the response is sufficiently different from its nominal value see the specifications table for the appropriate limits pll fault is active parity bit required for all data transmissions communications protocol requires one parity bit to achieve odd parity for the entire command bits that are in don care positions are still factored into the parity calculation these bits of device data can contain any of the following master data to be written to memory register as specified in slave sensor rate output data slave device data read from the memory register specified in as well as data from the next sequential register slave for write command the data that is written to the specified memory register is reflected back to the master device for correlation the spi bit is set when any of the following occurs too few bits are transmitted message from the control module contains parity error the occurrence of spi error results in the device issuing error response see table regardless of the spi command type see table issued by the master device the and status bits are used to signal to the master device the type of data contained in the response message the status bits are decoded as shown in table parity bit that establishes odd parity for bits of the device response parity bit that establishes odd parity for the entire device response communications error bit transmitted from the device to the control module request errors can occur when an invalid command is sent from the control module command specifies an invalid memory write command attempted to write to nonwritable memory register once the chip select pin cs is deasserted wait µs before reasserting the chip select pin cs and initiating another frame with the device failure to adhere to this timing specification

failure check generate faults regulator overvoltage failure that sets the st bits to the individual bits of the fault register are updated depending on their respective detection criteria however it is recommended that the fault register be read at rate of at least hz once asserted individual status bits are not deasserted until they are read by the master device if the error persists after fault register read the status bit immediately reasserts and remains asserted until the next sequential exchange the register is appended to every sensor data request the remaining fault information can be accessed by issuing read command to address this bit indicates that the device had failure in the phase lock loop functional circuit block which occurs when the pll fails to achieve sync with the resonator structure if the pll status flag is active the st bits of the sensor data response are set to indicating that the response contains potentially invalid rate data fault can be asserted based on two independent calculations located in the memory register address is value corresponding to the total quadrature present in the device if this value exceeds lsbs fault is issued separately an internal quadrature accumulator records the amount of quadrature correction performed by the fault is issued after the quadrature error present in the device contributes to an equivalent of typical of rate offset an nvm error is transmitted to the control module if the internal nvm data fails checksum calculation this check is performed once every µs and does not include the pid memory register an internal check is performed on device startup to ensure that the volatile memory of the device is functional this is accomplished by programming known value from the device rom into volatile memory register this value is continuously compared to the known value in rom every µs for the of the device operation if the value stored in the volatile memory changes or does not match the value stored in rom the por error flag is asserted the value stored in rom is rewritten to the volatile memory upon device power cycle the device performs continuous check of the internal regulated voltage level if either an overvoltage ov or uv fault is asserted the pwr bit is asserted as well these conditions occur when the regulated voltage is observed to be either more than or less than an internal filter removes high frequency glitching effects so that the pwr bit is not asserted unnecessarily to determine if the fault is result of an overvoltage or undervoltage condition the ov and uv fault bits must be analyzed the is designed with continuous measured amplitudes are compared against the limits presented in the specifications table deviation from this value results in reported error there are two thresholds for failure value lsbs from nominal results in an assertion of the flag in the fault register value lsbs from nominal results in both an assertion of the flag in the fault register and setting of the st bits to indicating that the rate data contained in the sensor data response is potentially invalid the chk bit is transmitted by the control module to the as method of generating faults by asserting the chk bit the device creates conditions that result in the generation of all faults represented through the fault register for example the amplitude is deliberately altered so that it exceeds the fault detection threshold resulting in error in this way the device is capable of checking both its ability to detect fault condition and its ability to report that fault to the control module the fault conditions are initiated nearly simultaneously however the timing for receiving fault codes when the chk bit is asserted is dependent upon the time required to generate each unique fault it takes not more than ms for all of the internal faults to be generated and the fault register to be updated to reflect the condition of the device until the chk bit is cleared the st status bits are set to indicating that the data should be interpreted by the control module as data after the chk bit is deasserted the fault conditions require an additional ms to decay and the device to return to normal operation see figure for the proper methodology for asserting the chk bit the ov fault bit asserts when the internally regulated voltage nominally is observed to exceed this measurement is low pass filtered to prevent artifacts such as noise spikes from asserting fault condition when an ov fault occurs the pwr fault bit is asserted simultaneously because the ov fault bit is not transmitted as part of sensor data request it is recommended that the user read back the and memory registers upon the assertion of pwr error this allows the user to determine the specific error condition data sheet the uv fault bit asserts when the internally regulated voltage nominally is observed to be less than this measurement is low pass filtered to prevent artifacts such as noise spikes from asserting fault condition when uv fault occurs the pwr fault bit is asserted simultaneously because the uv fault bit is not transmitted as part of sensor data request it is recommended that the user read back the and memory registers upon the assertion of pwr error this allows the user to determine the specific error condition the fail flag is asserted when condition arises such that the st bits are set to this indicates that the device has experienced gross failure and that the sensor data could potentially be invalid the amp fault bit is asserted when the measured amplitude of the silicon resonator has been significantly reduced this condition can occur if the voltage supplied to has fallen below the requirements of the internal voltage regulator this fault bit is or ed with the cst fault such that during sensor data request the cst bit position represents either an amp failure or cst failure the full fault status register can then be read from memory to validate the specific failure data sheet chk bit assertion recommended routine figure illustrates recommended routine that can be implemented by the user alternate sequences can be employed however take care that the response from the is handled correctly if implemented immediately after power is applied to the device the total time to implement the following fault detection routine is approximately as described in the device data latching section the data present in the device upon the assertion of the cs signal is used in the next sequential exchange this results in an apparent one transaction delay before the data resulting from the assertion of the chk bit is reported by the device for all other interactions with the device no such delay exists and the mosi command is serviced during the next sequential response exchange note that when the chk bit is deasserted if the user tries to obtain data from the device before the cst fault flag has cleared the device reports the data as error

registers that are available to be read by the user see the section for the proper input sequence to read specific memory register each memory register comprises eight bits of data however when read request is performed the data is always returned as message this is accomplished table memory map msb addr by appending the data from the next sequential register to the memory address that is specified data is transmitted msb first for proper acquisition of data from the memory register the read request should be made to the even register address only the memory map registers are described in the memory register definitions section memory register definitionsthe memory registers are described in this section as described in the previous section when requesting data from memory register only the first sequential memory address need be addressed the data returned by the device contains bits of memory register information bits contain the msb of the requested information and bits
